################MAVEN######################

Maven is a tool which compiles. It is a compilation tool which is used to compile only java projects. It wont support any other languages.
It will compile and create packages like binarys.

Ant is also a build tool, --> old tool of Maven. 

Vendor is apache for both Maven and Apache. 
it works with a build file. 
In Ant it is knwon as build file. 

In Maven it builds a build file first which is named as pom file. 
pom --> project object model

main things in pom
groupid
artifactid
version

1.src folder
2.pom.xml

src contains all our java files.

we will run the pom file. 


Maven is a softwarerpoject  management and a comprehensive tool. 


Maven can manage project builds, reporting on documentation from central piece of information. 

Using Maven we can build and manage any java based project. 

Maven provides developers a complete build life cycle framework.

Development team can automate the project build infrastructure in almost no time as maven uses standard layout directory and a default build life cycle.

Maven provides developers way to manage the following.
1.BUild
2.documentation
3.reports.
4.Handle dependency
5.Mailing lists.

It simplifies and standardises the project build process.(Conventional over configuration)

Developers are not required to create a build process by them because maven already creates the templates.

Developers do not have to mention each and every configuration details.

Maven provides sensible default behaviour for all projecrts. 

When maven project is created, it creates a default folder structure.

Developers is only required to place the files accordingly and need not put any configuration in pom.xml

release version format
1.0.0
major.minor.bugfix|patch

POM.(Project object Model)

It is a fundemental unit of work in maven. 
It is an xml filethat resides in the base directory as pom.xml
Pom contains information about the project and various configuration details used by maven to build the project. 

Pom also contains the goals(tasks) and plugins(Just like integration with other plugins).

While executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the pom in current directory. 

It reads the POM, get the needed configuration information and execute the goals.


$$$ Groupid and artifact id.$$$

group id will be almost like organisation name
artifact id will be applicatoin name.
Version

$$$Maven Build Lifecycle.

Build life cycle is a well defined sequence of phases which defines the order in which the goals are to be executed. 

3 lifecycle stages
-Clean,
-Default, 
-Site

mvn package -->it is default
with default it comes all these process
1.Validate pom file
2.initialize maven build
3.compile
4.test compile
5.junit test cases
6.package 
7.install

mvn clean package

cleans the previous build and so a fresh build

mvn clean package site --> this creates documentation of the application with all the details(dependency, plugins summary etc)

mvn compile --> it creates the .class files after compiling. it will also create target folder but not the war file.

mvn test --> does all the above till step 4
