integrating maven with sonarqube.

bring up sonarqube and maven instances. 


Generate a toke from sonarqube UI. 

login-->Myaccount-->security--> generate a token giving a name.

copy and paster the token. (One time generate token and one time viewable)

after this got to maven instance.

go inside the project and do mvn package. 

after that we are publishing to sonar for code quality checks

mvn package user:group -Dsonar.host.url=sonarqubeurl:9000 -Dsonar.login=tokenwhichwegenerated

mvn package sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://13.58.77.73:9000/ -Dsonar.login=03f251fd68b09d63d9c48333c088ecd634d598e5

once this is done our project is now linked with sonarqube.



We can set criterias and rules for quality checks in sonarqube.

Rules-->Quality Profiles
rules means things which should be followed by developers in the code. 

quality checks--> quality gate
coverage should 90% and above
duplications should be 10% or less. 
these kind of quality gate checks can be set for our code. 

set rules from Quality profiles

Create new quality profile from quality profile. 
add new rules to the profile. 

then we should run the command to trigger sonarqube again to make effect the changes. 

refresh sonarqube UI to see the changes and comparison between old and new changes
